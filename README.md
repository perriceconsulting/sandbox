# Sandbox React App

This project demonstrates a simple Spotify-like layout built with React.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Start the development server with Parcel:

```bash
npx parcel index.html
```

You can also use the npm script:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal to view the app.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is processed automatically by Parcel using the included `postcss.config.js`.
Simply run the development server (`npm start` or `npx parcel index.html`) and Tailwind
will build your styles.
